Here on Admin User dashboard Page: what are featured Users? What will happend on if user click on Detail link. Which information we will show on detail page? Is there HTML built for this page?

MObile Users: How many mobile users we will show below Client users? Will these be the latest users who signup on mobile?

These are the main data points I am looking to display in the dashboard.App Metrics and Dashboard
Users - Admin would see all users but the corporate user would see all the users on his team
(1) Twitter follower # - updated at regular intervals so that it tracks the # they had when they signed up and then when a call to twitter api occurs
(2) # of RT’s - again at install and then updated like above
(3) # of Favorites - same as above
(4) Gender break down and interests of followers.
- Male v Female
- Age categories
- Interests
- Location

Exchange & Offerz - Admin would see all offerz whereas others see only their own
(1) # of followers for all users that share an offer
(2) # of RT’s for each share of an offer
(3) # of Fav’s for each share of an offer
(4) # of followers for each person that RT’ed a share
(5) # of followers for each person that Fav’ed a share
(6) impressions = # of followers for all that shared an offer
(7) engagement = # of all RT’s + # Favs on a shared offer
(8) reach = total number of all followers for a shared offer + the total # of followers for all those that RT’ed that shared offer in twitter + total # of followers for all that Fav’ed that shared offer in twitter.
(9) cost of offer = dollar cost for the endorsement
(10) CPM (cost per mille) = Reach in thousands / cost in dollars
